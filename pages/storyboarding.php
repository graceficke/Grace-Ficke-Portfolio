									<p>This storyboard is a final iteration of my interpretation of the opening scene from The Fellowship of the Rings, which is the first in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. </p>

									<p>After many sketches and careful consideration I decided to feature only the narrative of the one ring, and it's relationship with Sauron. The opening scene being the forging of the ring, and the closing scene being the end of the partnership between Sauron and the ring. </p>

									<p>This movie is very dark, to emphasize this, I used cool gray markers, and colored pencil to smooth and bring out the bright ring. I think cool markers was the right direction to go because it adds a color harmony to the overall board.</p>
