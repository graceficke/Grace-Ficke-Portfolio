									<p>Oriental Wok is a high-end Asian cuisine restaurant with two locations in the Greater Cincinnati Area. When I came into the picture most of the menus and marketing materials were done in different styles not all matching the style of the restaurant. My goal was to change this. I was given the general color scheme, logo, and copy. From there I made the decision with the owner to separate the Carry Out Menu/ Catering menu into two separate pieces, that could be paired together or taken separately. We make this decision to be able to incorporate as much white space and food photography as possible.
