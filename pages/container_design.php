									<p>Pointz is start-up company hoping to unlock brand loyalty. The majority of consumers are switchers, and brands spend heavily to plug the leaky bucket. Pointz lowers the cost of retention and acquisition and can turn switchers into loyalists. The Pointz team is just three of us, a marketer and engineer with an MBA from Duke, a Computer Science tech enthusiast who is a graduate of Hanover College, and myself. I work closely with both our developer and marketer creating a look and feel for the brand, refining the logo, and designing the app and website. </p>
